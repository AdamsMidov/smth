                A few quick notes:
                <br><br>

                This privacy policy explains what data we collect as well as how and why we use your personal data
                The policy applies to you if you’re a supporter of the Trust (whether that’s as a member, donor,
                volunteer, tenant, customer or employee) or use any of our services, visit our website, use our mobile
                app, email, call or write to us. In certain circumstances we may also provide an extra privacy notice,
                which will always refer to this page
                We’ll never sell your personal data. We will only share it with organisations we work with who meet our
                high privacy standards.
                <br><br>

                Fundacja New Heritage (“New Heritage”, “us”, “we” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy and
                confidentiality of Personal Information we may collect. New Heritage has created this privacy policy
                (“Privacy Policy”) to advise you about our information practices, such as the types of information we
                collect and how we may use that information, and to inform you about your privacy rights and how the law
                protects you. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices
                regarding your Personal Information and how we will treat it. By visiting any part of our Websites (as
                defined below) or otherwise providing New Heritage with Personal Information by any means, you accept
                and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Websites
                (following the posting of a revised privacy policy) means that you accept and agree to the terms of the
                revised privacy policy, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
                <br><br>

                Individuals in the European Union (“EU”) should be sure to read the important information provided
                below, in addition to the other provisions in this Privacy Policy.

                <br><br>


                I. IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WHO WE ARE
                <br><br>

                A. Application of this privacy policy
                <br><br>

                This Privacy Policy applies to www.nheritage.org and all other websites, features, or online services
                that are owned or controlled by New Heritage and that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively,
                the “Websites”), whether accessed via computer, mobile device, or otherwise. Note, however, this Privacy
                Policy does not apply to use of unaffiliated websites that link to our Websites. Once you enter another
                website (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link), be aware that we are not
                responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites.
                <br><br>

                B. Purpose of this privacy policy
                <br><br>

                This Privacy Policy aims to give you information on how New Heritage collects and uses your Personal
                Information through your use of the Websites, including any information you may provide through the
                Websites when you sign up for an account, sign up to receive information or communications from us,
                purchase a product or service, or request further services or information from us.
                <br><br>

                It is important that you read this Privacy Policy together with any other privacy notice or fair
                processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or using Personal
                Information about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your information. This
                Privacy Policy supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.
                <br><br>

                C. Children

                <br><br>

                The Websites are not designed for, or directed to, children under the age of 16 and New Heritage does
                not intentionally collect information about anyone under the age of 16 on the Websites. If New Heritage
                discovers that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information from anyone younger than the age of
                16, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any
                Personal Information from a child under 16, please contact us at privacy@nheritage.org.
                <br><br>

                D. Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes

                <br><br>

                This version was last updated on September 10, 2020 and historic versions can be obtained by contacting
                us.
                <br><br>

                We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy
                Policy, simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Websites. Any such change, update
                or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Websites. If we make material changes
                to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email. However, unless you consent, New Heritage will not
                use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated in our posted
                Privacy Policy at the time your Personal Information was collected. Please check this Privacy Policy
                regularly to ensure you are aware of any changes in our practices.
                <br><br>
                It is important that the Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us
                informed if your Personal Information changes during your relationship with us. You are responsible for
                maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information. If you
                contact us with changes, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then-active
                databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Note, however, that information may persist internally for
                our administrative purposes and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.
