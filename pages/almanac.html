                <p>Landowners lived in their residences (called manors or palaces), which were surrounded with parks. A symbol of the landed gentry, the manor had always been regarded as inseparably connected with that social class. At the same time it was also lastingly connected with Polish culture, landscape, and history. Dating back to the 18th or 19th century, vast majority of the residences had been used for generations. They were enlarged and modernised when needed or when the trends changed. The manor was a family nest and a symbol of the continuity and strength of Polish tradition. Almost every residence housed valuable antiques and works of art. A series of family portraits was a must. Hanging on the walls in the dining or living room, it was a proof of the family’s long history. The portraits highlighted the services of the family members who had held important positions or had participated in significant historic events.

                    <br><br>

                    In 1921 Poland there were approx. 19,000 granges over 123 ac, encompassing approx. 28,000,000 ac of land (30 per cent of their total area). The average area of an estate was approx. 1500 ac. Polish interwar agriculture was in debt for many reasons: the destruction of estates during World War I, the low profitability of agricultural production, and the Depression during 1929–1933. Some estates were poorly managed and their owners did not invest in their development. Moreover, the tax rates for vast estates were higher than for small farms. The many landed gentry who were in arrears with their taxes for the State Treasury were forced to parcel out their estates. The steps taken by the government, such as the debt restructuring act, and the upturn in the economy improved the situation of landed gentry just before the outbreak of World War II.
                    
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Despite  being perceived as a homogenous group from the outside, the landed gentry were highly diverse. At the top of the social hierarchy  was the aristocracy—a  very narrow, hermetic group, which successfully defended its status. It was composed of a few dozen of the most well-known families with historic surnames and aristocratic titles, usually of counts (hrabia) or princes (książę). Most of them were from noble families that held important public positions in the First Republic of Poland. Later on they were joined by families that achieved a high social and material status in the 19th century.
                    <br><br>
                    Aristocrats possessed many vast estates in various parts of the country and magnificent historic residences, for instance, in Głochów,  Kozłówka, Łańcut, Nieborów,  Nieśwież, and Sławuta. They invested their savings in shares of banks and industrial companies. The aristocrats’ standard of living was very high: they often travelled abroad, pursued careers in politics, and collected works ofart. The aristocracy married exclusively with members from their own social class, which prevented outsiders from entering it. Moreover, aristocrats were often connected by marriage with the ruling families.</p>

                <p>In 1939, there  were approximately 16,000 manors and 5,000 palaces within the borders of Poland as constituted. Following the Stalinist Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN)  decree of 06.09.1944, the state confiscated  all estates, livestock,  crops, movables such as furniture, paintings, works of art, books and personal effects without compensation. The decree  prohibited owners from settling within the district (poviat) of their  former properties. 350,000 people were affected by this legislation. Further decrees deprived owners of factories, banks, tenement houses,  pharmacies, forests, and securities. Almost a tenth of Poland's  population, some 2 million people, lost their property and livelihoods. The agricultural reform in Poland had a political, not economic,  purpose. The aim was to destroy the Polish landed gentry, a patriotic  and often highly educated class resistant to the Sovietisation of the country. The reform undermined the legal and social order based on the  right of  property ownership. Following the end of communism in 1989, some mansions were successfully  reclaimed by their pre-war owners, despite the Polish state’s  reluctance. Owners were either compelled to buy them back or regain them  through litigation at the European Court. 
                    <br><br>
                    In 2013, the Registry of Objects of Cultural Heritage listed 2,700 manors  and 2,000 palaces. 3,700 were in ruins, undergoing radical  reconstruction or had been totally stripped of assets. Deprived of land,  buildings loose their economic infrastructure and viability. 160 manors  and 80 palaces remain in their original architectural state, a little over 1 percent of the prewar inventory. However, none survived the  communist period with its economic infrastructure intact. The Polish Parliament has yet to pass re-privatisation legislation,  making Poland the only EU country in which property rights are not  respected. The war time Stalinist decrees are still in force in Poland.
                    <br><br>
                    Approximately  1,000 manors and palaces could still be saved.</p>
