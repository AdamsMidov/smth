            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Standing on the edge of what had once been a prosperous and extensive 19th century red-bricked farmyard stood a splendid neo-classical house. It was the sort of house that anyone would want to live in. Not too big and not too small. 
                Elegant and charming. Inexplicably, it was deserted and open to the elements.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="double__img"></div>
        <div class="double__img__history">
            <p>This palace built between 1790 and 1825 is one of the interesting examples of classicism architecture in Poland, designed by architect Chrystian Piotr Aigner with a small contribution by of so called architect amateur Stanisław Kostka Potocki. Farm buildings designed by Henryk Marconi. The Kicki family came into possession of the palace at the end of the 18th century by marriage, of whom it's most notable and last owner was count Kajetan Kicki. At the end of his life in 1878, he left his whole estate in his will for social welfare. On the basis of that in 1896 the first agricultural school in the Kingdom of Poland was opened. <br><br>

                About ten years ago our director Richard Berkeley-Dennis came across this magnificent house and said: I was driving cross-country from Lublin to Warsaw when I saw a sign to Sobieszyn. 
                It occurred to me that there might be some link with the Sobieski family and, that if there were, there might be a house worth seeing. Being in no hurry to get back to Warsaw I followed my instinct. The village itself is an unremarkable linear development stretching over a couple of kilometres. When the road seemed to be about to peter out my curiosity was rewarded. A few weeks later I returned with a film-maker and we made a short documentary about the house, which you can see below.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="history__continue">
            <p>Two years ago I was invited to Lublin city hall to discuss a project with the city authorities. In passing, I mentioned Sobieszyn and wondered what had happened to the house. They checked-up and discovered that it was for sale. We met the relevant authorities at Ryki town hall and discovered a scandal of shocking proportions. Some time before, the town had sold the house at a bargain price to some fraudsters masquerading as investors with a plan. Following the sale, these people had managed to raise 19 million zloty from various sources for restoration work before they disappeared with all the funds. Naturally, they had failed to spend anything on the house. A bank, which had taken the house as collateral for some of the lost money, wanted a return. Thus, the bank had put the house on the market. Two years on there have been no takers because the 4 million price tag is unrealistic. The house remains open to the elements. It won’t last many more winters. <br><br>

                What is extraordinary is that this story of the exploitation of the national heritage is not unique. It seems that many historic houses in Poland have been used as means of raising capital illicitly. Why is so little being done to preserve this vital part of Poland’s heritage? The government has made heritage a priority and yet it is government agencies which seem to be responsible for its neglect.

              <p>Sobieszyn is a lovely house. It could have many uses. Whatever it could be it won’t be unless someone does something very soon to preserve it. This is why we have decided to take the necessary steps in order to protect it from further decaying. We will keep you updated, but in the mean time please check out our social feed. The restoration of the palace would not be possible without the unending support and help from the volunteers. <br><br>

                The focus of the restoration currently looks towards the interior of the palace, through an extensive project to restore the ground floor and create an architectural installation. We are currently preparing the project and it is scheduled to launch through winter 2020 and main launch in spring 2021.</p>
