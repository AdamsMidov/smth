                <h1>Preserving the Past</h1>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p>Poland has a broad heritage of historic residences - from stately homes in the countryside and urban mansions through to Magnets’ fortified citadels, redundant Bishops’ palaces, and more modest manor houses. Of those few that survived the Second World War, not many were fortunate enough to resume their past splendour. The majority of those buildings were nationalised - what was once the home of the nobility was often crudely converted into hospitals, orphanages, schools, farm management offices, and public housing during the communist period. Thus, to an extent their survival was guaranteed. Since the fall of Communism many have had a more challenging histories.
                    <br><br>
                    The pressure on the state to divest itself of its obligations to maintain these historic buildings has led to a number of privatisations. Some residences have been returned to their original owners and others converted into hotels and other businesses under private ownership. Some have been the subject of financial malpractice. Yet some still remain untouched since the communist period or have been simply abandoned and left to the elements.</p>

                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>The New Heritage Foundation was founded in 2019 with the mission of preserving historic domestic buildings in Poland. The number of dilapidating Polish historic residences dramatically increasing over the recent years urged us to take action to preserve and bring them into contemporary times. Throughout history, these architectural gems were and in some instances, still remain, at the centre of their communities. Our ultimate challenge lies in finding a purposes and solution for each that will ensure their survival in the 21st century and give these masterpieces new life.

            <div class="new__foundation">
                <p>The New Heritage Foundation for Historic Estates in the Lands of the former Kingdom of Poland aims to preserve, inspire, raise awareness and undertake actions channelled at restoring and giving new use to historic buildings and places in serious danger of demolition, abandonment or squander.
                    <br><br>
                    The long term objective of the New Heritage Foundation is to establish an association with institutions such as The National Heritage Board of Poland and individuals throughout the world, who will enable us to work further for the preservation of historic buildings in Poland. This means involving people throughout society from state institutions to private individuals who share our vision, enthusiasm and determination to preserve these unique symbols of Poland’s national identity.</p>

From a very young age he has been interested in history and the origin of his family, and with it came a fascination for the cultural and architectural heritage of the region that is currently Poland. After his graduation in law at Leiden University he got involved in various Dutch organisations concerning the preservation of and information about old country houses, estates and the families who lived in it. It makes me very happy to witness the rise of such an organisation in Poland; a land that is so rich in cultural and architectural heritage. I very much hope that through New Heritage Poland I can make a contribution to the much needed preservation of that valuable heritage.</p>

Paint analysis is a small and highly specialised field, requiring the combined skills of historian, detective and analyst. Among these pages are the stories of many buildings, some thought lost to fire, or ignorance and decay whose history has been recovered and subsequently recreated. Through paint analysis and the application of 30 years experience in historic interiors, Patrick is able to paint a picture of the past.
