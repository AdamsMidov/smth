                We believe heritage buildings have a future. From cottages to castles

                        <p>There are many projects that represent New Heritage Foundation’ key principles of
                            Guardianship, Discovery, Showmanship and Independence which would not have been possible
                            without support from donations. You can become a volunteer worker with us and gain much
                            interested experience. Making new friends, working in amazing places and knowing that you're
                            helping a great cause - three fabulous reasons to get volunteering!
                            <br>
                            Another great way to become a volunteer is to share with us any particular information of
                            the historic houses that need saving. Perhaps there is one in your village or on a farm or
                            in the middle of your town. Perhaps you know people who have stories to tell about these
                            houses and the people who have lived in them?
                            <br>
                            If you do, we need your help. Every story matters.
                            <br>
                            However, if you know of a house but don’t know any stories, tell us and we can try to point
                            you in the right direction. Perhaps you could start by asking friends and relatives what
                            they remember. Take some pictures and tell us what you feel about the house.

                        </div>
                        <p>A curator is a manager or overseer. Many heritage buildings are abandoned or in a sorry
                            state. If you know of a heritage building near you that needs help and you don't know where
                            to start, contact us and we will do our best to support you. Consider becoming the voluntary
                            guardian of the building by providing us with a record of the building’s condition. We will
                            make this public, thus raising awareness of the problem.
                            <br><br>
                            Awareness is the first step to renovation.
                            <br><br>
                            Traditionally, a curator or keeper of a cultural heritage institution is a content
                            specialist charged with an institution's collections and involved with the interpretation of
                            heritage material including historical artefacts. A public-private historic preservation
                            program that offers the opportunity for outside parties to lease unique historic houses and
                            buildings. If you know a heritage building in your area that needs help and you don't know
                            where to start contact us and we can guide and support you. You can become the curator or
                            the guardian of the building. It will only require a bit of your time and we will supply the
                            rest. We can slow down the deteriorating process by far, through regular visits to the
                            buildings in need.

                            back to life. Receive regular video updates of the progress and have the opportunity to talk
                            to the restorers during their painstaking work. Your contribution to the restored space will
                            be recognised with a bronze plaque bearing your name, linking you to the house in
                            perpetuity.

By associating with the NHP we can offer your firm a number of exciting sponsorship opportunities, including major events and publications; a platform to speak to our audiences; and benefits for your staff and clients. 
                    As a NHP Corporate Partner we can also help you to meet your companies CSR aspirations.

            <h1>Corporate supporters</h1>
            <p>Bring all the benefits of NHP membership to your employees, in the knowledge that you are enhancing your employment offer, providing them with valuable access to professional development and publicly lending your organisation's support to the work of the NHP.
                <br><br>
                Our Corporate Supporters are like minded charities, small companies and large firms who are an active part of the building conservation sector. We can help you to offer NHP membership as a benefit to you and your employees. You don't have to be a big firm to take part, we recognise that many providers of building conservation skills are small organisations. Just three memberships is all you need to get started. As a thank you we will list your organisation's name on our website and those offering more than three memberships to their staff will qualify for a discount.</p>
