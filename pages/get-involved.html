                        <br>
                        <br>Another great way to become a volunteer is to share with us any particular information of
                        <br> the historic houses that need saving. Perhaps there is one in your village or on a farm or
                        <br>  in the middle of your town. Perhaps you know people who have stories to tell about these
                        <br> houses and the people who have lived in them?
                        <br>
                        <br> If you do, we need your help. Every story matters.
                        <br>
                        <br> However, if you know of a house but don’t know any stories, tell us and we can try to point
                        <br> you in the right direction. Perhaps you could start by asking friends and relatives what
                        <br>they remember. Take some pictures and tell us what you feel about the house.

                         <br>to start, contact us and we will do our best to support you. Consider becoming the voluntary
                         <br>guardian of the building by providing us with a record of the building’s condition. We will
                         <br> make this public, thus raising awareness of the problem.

                         <br>Traditionally, a curator or keeper of a cultural heritage institution is a content

                         <br>heritage material including historical artefacts. A public-private historic preservation
                         <br> program that offers the opportunity for outside parties to lease unique historic houses and
                         <br>buildings. If you know a heritage building in your area that needs help and you don't know
                         <br>where to start contact us and we can guide and support you. You can become the curator or
                         <br>the guardian of the building. It will only require a bit of your time and we will supply the
                         <br> rest. We can slow down the deteriorating process by far, through regular visits to the
                         <br>buildings in need.
